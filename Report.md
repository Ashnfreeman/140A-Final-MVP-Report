# **Market Opportunity and Business Model Madlib**
  SmartNote is a B2C organization that serves students who need a cheap, seamless, and portable way to take, organize, and carry their notes. We will generate revenue using ad-based and transactional revenue models.
 
## Addressable Market Size
 We estimate our market size to be upwards of 50,000 people, according to statistics released on the number of downloads for popular tablet note-taking apps. Our addressable market size is all college students in the US that donâ€™t currently own a tablet, approximately 35 million. 

## Barriers to Entry
One potential barrier to entry would be the fact that there are already many tablets in the market.  Although ours has a very focused purpose we would still have to successful distinguish the SmartNote from other tablets. 

# Personas
* Erin is a student at UCSD. Unfortunately, she suffers from Scoliosis and because her surgeon has instructed her not to carry more than 10% of her bodyweight in her backpack, she is unable to carry all of the school supplies that she needs with her.

* David is a disorganized engineering student at UCSD. Because so many of his current classes rely on information from previous classes, he has to frequently refer back to his old notes. He struggles to keep his notes organized, and often finds himself needing notes he left at home.

* Colette is a graduating senior at UCSD. She plans to go to grad school eventually, and is not sure if she'll need her notes in the future. She plans on moving across the country after graduation, and doesn't want to move her copious amounts of notes she took in her undergrad.

* Felix is a college student who is on a budget.  He notices other people in his classes taking notes on I-pad Pros and Microsoft Surfaces and would love to use a similar product.  However he is unable to afford the cost of one of these devices.

* Lucy S. Diaz is college student who is very concious of her carbon footprint.  She wants to be able to take notes and do homework without killing so many trees.
