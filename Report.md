# **Personas**

* Erin is a student at UCSD. Unfortunately, she suffers from Scoliosis and because her surgeon has instructed her not to carry more than 10% of her bodyweight in her backpack, she is unable to carry all of the school supplies that she needs with her.

* David is an engineering student at UCSD. Because so many of his current classes rely on information from previous classes, he has to frequently refer back to his old notes. He struggles to keep his notes organized, and often finds himself needing notes he left at home.

* Colette is a graduating senior at UCSD. She plans to go to grad school eventually, and is not sure if she'll need her notes in the future. She plans on moving across the country after graduation, and doesn't want to move her copious amounts of notes she took in her undergrad.
